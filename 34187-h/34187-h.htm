<h3>A NEW BANKING SYSTEM.</h3>


<p>Under the banking system&mdash;an outline of which is
hereafter given&mdash;the real estate of Boston alone&mdash;taken
at only three-fourths its value, as estimated by
the State valuation<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>&mdash;is capable of furnishing three
hundred millions of dollars of loanable capital.</p>

<p>Under the same system, the real estate of Massachusetts&mdash;taken
at only three-fourths its estimated
value<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>&mdash;is capable of furnishing seven hundred and
fifty millions of loanable capital.</p>

<p>The real estate of the Commonwealth, therefore, is
capable of furnishing an amount of loanable capital
more than twelve times as great as that of all the
"<i>National</i>" Banks in the State<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>; more than twice as
great as that of all the "National" banks of the whole
United States ($353,917,470); and equal to the entire
amount ($750,000,000, or thereabouts) both of greenback
and "National" bank currency of the United
States.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>
<p>It is capable of furnishing loanable capital equal to
one thousand dollars for every male and female person,
of sixteen years of age and upwards, within the Commonwealth;
or two thousand five hundred dollars for
every male adult.</p>

<p>It would scarcely be extravagant to say that it is
capable of furnishing ample capital for every deserving
enterprise, and every deserving man and woman, within
the State; and also for all such other enterprises in
other parts of the United States, and in foreign commerce,
as Massachusetts men might desire to engage in.</p>

<p>Unless the same system, or some equivalent one,
should be adopted in other States, the capital thus
furnished in this State, could be loaned at high interest
at the West and the South.</p>

<p>If adopted here earlier than in other States, it would
enable the citizens of this State to act as pioneers in
the most lucrative enterprises that are to be found in
other parts of the country.</p>

<p>All this capital is now lying dead, so far as being
loaned is concerned.</p>

<p>All this capital can be loaned in the form of currency,
if so much can be used.</p>

<p>All the profits of banking, under this system, would
be clear profits, inasmuch as the use of the real estate
as banking capital, would not interfere at all with its
use for other purposes.</p>

<p>The use of this real estate as banking capital would
break up all monopolies in banking, and in all other
business depending upon bank loans. It would diffuse
credit much more widely than it has ever been diffused.
It would reduce interest to the lowest rates to which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
free competition could reduce it. It would give immense
activity and power to industrial and commercial
enterprise. It would multiply machinery, and do
far more to increase production than any other system
of credit and currency that has ever been invented.
And being furnished at low rates of interest, would
secure to producers a much larger share of the proceeds
of their labor, than they now receive.</p>

<p>All this capital can be brought into use as fast as
the titles to real estate can be ascertained, and the
necessary papers be printed.</p>

<p>Legally, the system (as the author claims, and is
prepared to establish) stands upon the same principle
as a patented machine; and is, therefore, already legalized
by Congress; and cannot, unless by a breach of
the public faith, any more be prohibited, <i>or taxed</i>,
either by Congress or this State, than can the use of a
patented machine.</p>

<p>Every dollar of the currency furnished by this system
would have the same value in the market as a
dollar of gold; or so nearly the same value that the
difference would be a matter of no appreciable importance.</p>

<p>The system would, therefore, restore specie payments
at once, by furnishing a great amount of currency,
that would be equal in value to specie.</p>

<p>The system would not inflate prices above their true
and natural value, relatively to specie; for no possible
amount of paper currency, every dollar of which is
equal in value to specie, <i>can</i> inflate prices above their
true and natural value, relatively to specie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>Whenever, if ever, the paper should not buy as much
in the market as specie, it would be returned to the
banks for redemption, and thus taken out of circulation.
So that no more could be kept in circulation
than should be necessary for the purchase and sale of
property at specie prices.</p>

<p>The system would not tend to drive specie out of
the country; although very little of it would be needed
by the banks. It would rather tend to bring specie
into the country, because it would immensely increase
our production. We should, therefore, have much
more to sell, and much less to buy. This would always
give a balance in our favor, which would have to be
paid in specie.</p>

<p>It is, however, a matter of no practical importance
whether the system would bring specie into the country,
or drive it out; for the volume and value of the
currency would be substantially unaffected either by
the influx or efflux of specie. Consequently industry,
trade, and prices would be undisturbed either by the
presence or absence of specie. The currency would
represent property that could not be exported; that
would always be here; that would always have a value
as fixed and well known as that of specie; that would
always be many times more abundant than specie can
ever be; and that could always be delivered (in the
absence of specie) in redemption of the currency.
These attributes of the currency would render all
financial contractions, revulsions, and disorders forever
impossible.</p>

<p>The following is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">An Outline of the System.</span></p>

<p>The principle of the system is that the currency
shall represent an <i>invested</i> dollar, instead of a specie
dollar.</p>

<p>The currency will, therefore, be redeemable by an
<i>invested</i> dollar, except when redeemed by specie, or by
being received in payment of debts due the banks.</p>

<p>The best capital will probably be mortgages and railroads;
and these will very likely be the only capital
which it will ever be expedient to use.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as railroads could not be used as capital,
without a modification of their present charters, mortgages
are probably the best capital that is immediately
available.</p>

<p>Supposing mortgages to be the capital, they will be
put into joint stock, held by trustees, and divided into
shares of one hundred dollars each.</p>

<p>This stock may be called the <span class="smcap">Productive Stock</span>, and
will be entitled to the dividends.</p>

<p>The dividends will consist of the interest on the
mortgages, and the profits of banking.</p>

<p>The interest on the mortgages should be so high&mdash;say
six or seven per cent&mdash;as to make the <span class="smcap">Productive
Stock</span> worth ordinarily par of specie in the market,
<i>independently of the profits of banking</i>.</p>

<p>Another kind of stock, which may be called <i>Circulating
Stock</i>, will be created, <i>precisely equal in amount
to the</i> <span class="smcap">Productive Stock</span>, and divided into shares of <i>one
dollar each</i>.</p>

<p>This <i>Circulating Stock</i> will be represented by certificates,
scrip, or bills, of various denominations, like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
our present bank bills&mdash;that is, <i>representing one, two,
three, five, ten, or more shares, of one dollar each</i>.</p>

<p>These certificates, scrip, or bills of the <i>Circulating
Stock</i>, will be issued for circulation as currency, as our
bank bills are now.</p>

<p>In law, this <i>Circulating Stock</i> will be in the nature
of a lien on the <span class="smcap">Productive Stock</span>. It will be entitled
to no dividends. Its value will consist, <i>first</i>, in its
title to be received in payment of all dues to the bank;
<i>second</i>, in its title to be redeemed, either in specie on
demand, or in specie, with interest from the time of
demand, before any dividends can be made to the
bankers; and, <i>third</i>, in its title, when not redeemed
with specie, to be redeemed (in sums of one hundred
dollars each) by a transfer of a corresponding amount
of the capital itself; that is, of the <span class="smcap">Productive Stock</span>.</p>

<p>The holders of the <i>Circulating Stock</i> are, therefore,
sure, <i>first</i>, to be able to use it (if they have occasion
to do so) in payment of their dues to the bank; <i>second</i>,
to get, in exchange for it, either specie on demand, or
specie, with interest from the time of demand; or,
<i>third</i>, a share of the capital itself, the <span class="smcap">Productive
Stock</span>; a stock worth par of specie in the market, and
as merchantable as a share of railroad stock, or government
stock, or any other stock whatever is now.</p>

<p>Whenever <span class="smcap">Productive Stock</span> shall have been transferred
in redemption of <i>Circulating Stock</i>, it (the
<span class="smcap">Productive Stock</span>) may be itself redeemed, or bought
back, at pleasure, by the bankers, on their paying its
face in specie, with interest (or dividends) from the time
of the transfer; and <i>must</i> be so bought back, before
any dividends can be paid to the original bankers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>The fulfilment of all these obligations, on the part
of the bank, is secured by the fact that the capital and
all the resources of the bank are in the hands of trustees,
who are legally bound&mdash;before making any
dividends to the bankers&mdash;to redeem all paper in the
manner mentioned; and also to buy back all <span class="smcap">Productive
Stock</span> that shall have been transferred in redemption
of the circulation.</p>

<p>Such are the general principles of the system. The
details are too numerous to be given here. They will
be found in the "<i>Articles of Association of a Mortgage
Stock Banking Company</i>," which the author has
drawn up and copyrighted.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>SPECIE PAYMENTS.</h3>


<p>Although the banks, under this system, make no
absolute promise to pay specie <i>on demand</i>, the system
nevertheless affords a much better <i>practical</i> guaranty
for specie payments, than the old specie paying system
(so called); and for these reasons, viz:</p>

<p>1. The banks would be so universally solvent, and
so universally known to be solvent, that no runs would
ever be made upon them for specie, through fear of
their insolvency. They could, therefore, maintain specie
payments with much less amounts of specie, than
the old specie paying banks (so called) could do.</p>

<p>2. As there would be no fears of the insolvency of
the banks, and as the paper would be more convenient
than specie for purposes of trade, bills would rarely be
presented for redemption&mdash;otherwise than in payment
of debts due the banks&mdash;except in those cases where
the holders desired to invest their money; and would
therefore <i>prefer</i> a transfer of <span class="smcap">Productive Stock</span>, to a
payment in specie. If they wanted specie for exportation,
they would buy it in the market (with the
bills), as they would any other commodities for export.<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a>
It would, therefore, usually be only when they
wanted an investment, and could find none so good as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
the <span class="smcap">Productive Stock</span>, that they would return their
bills for redemption. And then they would return
them, not really for the purpose of having them
redeemed with specie, but in the hope of getting a
transfer of <span class="smcap">Productive Stock</span>, and holding it awhile,
and drawing interest on it.</p>

<p>3. The banks would probably find it for their interest,
as promoting the circulation of their bills, to pay,
at all times, such <i>small</i> amounts of specie, as the
public convenience might require.</p>

<p>4. If there should be any suspensions of specie
payments, they would be only temporary ones, by
here and there a bank separately, and not by all the
banks simultaneously, as under the so called specie
paying system. No general public inconvenience
would therefore ever be felt from that cause.</p>

<p>5. If the banks should rarely, or never, pay specie
<i>on demand</i>, that fact would bring no discredit upon
their bills, and be no obstacle to their circulation at
par with specie. It would be known that&mdash;unless
bad notes had been discounted&mdash;all the bills issued by
the banks, would be wanted to pay the debts due the
banks. This would ordinarily be sufficient, of itself,
to keep the bills at par with specie. It would also be
known that, if specie were not paid <i>on demand</i>, it
would either be paid afterwards, with interest from the
time of demand; or <span class="smcap">Productive Stock</span>, equal in value
to specie in the market, would be transferred in redemption
of the bills. The bills, therefore, would
never depreciate in consequence of specie not being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
paid <i>on demand</i>; nor would any contraction of the
currency ever be occasioned on that account.</p>

<p>For the reasons now given, the system is practically
the best specie paying system that was ever invented.
That is to say, it would require less specie to work it;
and also less to keep its bills always at par with specie.
In proportion to the amount of currency it would furnish,
it would not require so much as one dollar in specie,
where the so called specie paying system would require
a hundred. It would also, by immensely increasing
our production and exports, do far more than any other
system, towards bringing specie into the country, and
preventing its exportation.</p>

<p>If it should be charged that the system supplies no
specie for <i>exportation</i>; the answer is, that it is really
no part of the legitimate business of a bank to furnish
specie for exportation. Its legitimate business is simply
to furnish credit and currency for home industry
and trade. And it can never furnish these constantly,
and in adequate amounts, unless it can be freed from
the obligation to supply specie on demand for exportation.
Specie should, therefore, always be merely an
article of merchandise in the market, like any other;
and should have no special&mdash;or, at least, no important&mdash;connection
with the business of banking, except as
furnishing the measure of value. If a paper currency
is made payable in specie, <i>on demand</i>, very little of it
can ever be issued, or kept in circulation; and that
little will be so irregular and inconstant in amount as
to cause continual and irremediable derangements.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
But if a paper currency, instead of promising to pay
specie <i>on demand</i>, promises only an alternative redemption,
viz: specie on demand, or specie with interest
from the time of demand, or other merchantable
property of equal market value with specie&mdash;it can
then be issued to an amount equal to such property;
and yet keep its promises to the letter. It can, therefore,
furnish all the credit and currency that can be
needed; or at least many times more than the so called
specie paying system ever did, or ever can, furnish. And
then the interest, industry and trade of a nation will
never be disturbed by the exportation of specie. And
yet the standard of value will always be maintained.</p>

<p>The difference between the system here proposed,
and the so called specie paying system&mdash;in respect to
their respective capacities for furnishing credit and currency,
and at the same time fulfilling their contracts to
the letter&mdash;is as fifty to one, at the least, in favor of
the former; probably much more than that.</p>

<p>Thus under the system now proposed, the real estate
and railroads of the United States, at their present values,
are capable of furnishing twenty thousand millions
($20,000,000,000) of paper currency; and furnishing
it constantly, and without fluctuation, and every dollar
of it will have an equal market value with gold. The
contracts or certificates comprising it, can always be
fulfilled to the letter; that is, the capital itself, (the
<span class="smcap">Productive Stock</span>,) represented by these certificates,
can always be delivered, <i>on demand</i>, in redemption of
the certificates, if the banks should be unable to redeem
in specie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other hand, it would be impossible to have so
much as four hundred millions, ($400,000,000)&mdash;one
fiftieth of the amount before mentioned&mdash;of so called
specie paying paper currency; that is, a paper promising
to pay specie <i>on demand</i>; <i>and constantly able to
fulfil its obligations</i>.</p>

<p>It is of no appreciable importance that a paper currency
should be payable <i>on demand</i> with specie. It is
sufficient, if it be payable <i>according to its terms, if only
those terms are convenient and acceptable</i>. For then
the value of the currency will be known, <i>and its contracts
will be fulfilled to the letter</i>. And when these contracts
are fulfilled to the letter, then, <i>to all practical
purposes, specie payments are maintained</i>. When, for
example, a man promises to pay wheat, either on demand,
or at a time specified, and he fulfils that contract
to the letter, <i>that, to all practical purposes, is
specie payments</i>; as much so as if the promise and payment
had been made in coin. <span class="smcap">It is, therefore, the
specific and literal fulfilment of contracts, that
constitutes specie payments; and not the particular
kind of property that is promised and paid.</span></p>

<p>The great secret, then, of having an abundant paper
currency, and yet maintaining all the while specie
payments, consists in having the paper represent property&mdash;like
real estate, for example&mdash;that exists in
large amounts, and can always be delivered, on demand,
in redemption of the paper; and also in having
this paper issued by the persons who actually own the
property represented by it, and who can be compelled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
by law to deliver it in redemption of the paper. And
the great secret&mdash;if it be a secret&mdash;of having only a
scanty currency, and of <i>not</i> having specie payments,
consists in having the paper issued by a government
that cannot fulfil its contracts, and has no intention of
fulfilling them; and by banks that are not even required
to fulfil them.</p>

<p>It is somewhat remarkable that after ten years experiment,
we have not yet learned these apparently
self-evident truths.</p>

<p>The palpable fact is that the advocates of the present
"National" currency system,&mdash;that is, the stockholders
in the present "National" banks,&mdash;<i>do not
wish for specie payments</i>. They wish only to maintain,
in their own hands, a monopoly of banking, and, as far
as possible also, a monopoly of all business depending
upon bank loans. They wish, therefore, to keep the
volume of the currency down to its present amount.
As an excuse for this, they profess a great desire for
specie payments; and at the same time practice the
imposture of declaring that specie payments will be
impossible, if the amount of the currency be increased.</p>

<p>But all this is sheer falsehood and fraud. It is, of
course, impossible to have specie payments, so long as
the only currency issued is issued by a government
that has nothing to redeem with, and has no intention
of redeeming; and by banks that are not even required
to redeem. But there is no obstacle to our having
twenty times as much currency as we now have, and
yet having specie payments&mdash;or the literal fulfilment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
of contracts&mdash;if we will but suffer the business of
banking to go into the hands of those who have property
with which to redeem, and can be compelled by
law to redeem.</p>

<p>It is with government paper, and bank paper, as it is
with the paper of private persons; that is, it is worth
just what can be delivered in redemption of it, and no
more. We all understand that the notes of the Astors,
and Stewarts, and Vanderbilts, though issued by millions,
and tens of millions, are really worth their nominal
values. And why? Solely because the makers of
them have the property with which to redeem them in
full, and can be made to redeem them in full. We also
all understand that the notes of Sam Jones, and Jim
Smith, and Bill Nokes, though issued for only five dollars,
are not worth two cents on the dollar. And why?
Solely because they have nothing to pay with; and
cannot be made to pay.</p>

<p>Suppose, now, that these notes of Sam Jones, and
Jim Smith, and Bill Nokes, for five dollars, were the
only currency allowed by law; and that they were
worth in the market but two cents on the dollar. And
suppose that the few holders of these notes, wishing to
make the most of them, at the expense of the rights
of everybody else, should keep up a constant howl for
specie payments; and should protest against any issue
of the notes of the Astors, the Stewarts, and the Vanderbilts,
upon the ground that such issue would inflate
the currency, and postpone specie payments! What
would we think of men capable of uttering such ab<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>surdities?
Would we in charity to their weakness, call
them idiots? or would we in justice to their villainy,
denounce them as impostors and cheats of the most
transcendent and amazing impudence? And what
would we think of the wits of forty millions of people,
who could be duped by such preposterous falsehoods?</p>

<p>And yet this is scarcely an exaggerated picture of
the fraud that has been practiced upon the people for
the last ten years. A few men have secured to themselves
the monopoly of a few irredeemable notes; and
not wishing to have any competition, either in the
business of banking, or in any business depending
upon bank loans, they cry out for specie payments;
and declare that no <i>solvent</i> or <i>redeemable</i> notes must
be put into circulation, in competition with their
<i>insolvent</i> and <i>irredeemable</i> ones, lest the currency be
inflated, and specie payments be postponed!</p>

<p>And this imposture is likely to be palmed off upon
the people in the future, as it has been in the past, if
they are such dunces as to permit it to be done.</p>

<p>It is perfectly evident, then, that specie payments&mdash;or
the literal fulfilment of contracts&mdash;does not depend
at all upon the amount of paper in circulation as
currency; but solely upon the fact whether, on the one
hand, it be issued by those who have property with
which to redeem it, and can be made to redeem it; or
whether, on the other hand, it be issued by those who
cannot redeem it, and cannot be made to redeem it.</p>

<p>When the people shall understand these simple, manifest
truths, they will soon put an end to the monopoly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
extortion, fraud, and tyranny of the existing "National"
system.</p>

<p>The "National" system, so called, is, in reality, no
national system at all; except in the mere facts that it
is called the national system, and was established by
the national government. It is, in truth, only a private
system; a mere privilege conferred upon a few, to
enable them to control prices, property, and labor; and
thus to swindle, plunder, and oppress all the rest of the
people.</p>

<h3>NO INFLATION OF PRICES.</h3>


<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> 1.</h4>

<p>In reality there is no such thing as an inflation of
prices, relatively to gold. There is such a thing as a
depreciated paper currency. That is to say, there is
such a thing as a paper currency, that is called by the
same names as gold&mdash;to wit, money, dollars, &amp;c.&mdash;but
that cannot be redeemed in full; and therefore has
not the same value as gold. Such a currency does not
circulate at its nominal, but only at its real, value.
And when such a currency is in circulation, and prices
are measured by it, instead of gold, they are said to
be inflated, relatively to gold. But, in reality, the
prices of property are not thereby inflated at all relatively
to gold. It is only the measuring of prices by a
currency, that is called by the same names as gold, but
that is really inferior in value to gold, that causes the
<i>apparent</i>, not <i>real</i>, inflation of prices, relatively to
gold.</p>

<p>To measure prices by a currency that is called by
the same names as gold, but that is really inferior in
value to gold, and then&mdash;because those prices are
nominally higher than gold prices&mdash;to say that they
are inflated, relatively to gold, is a perfect absurdity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>If we were to call a foot measure a yard, and were
then to say that all cloth measured by it became thereby
stretched to three times its length, relatively to a
true yard-stick, we should simply make ourselves ridiculous.
We should not thereby prove that the foot
measure had really stretched the cloth, but only that it
had taxed our brains beyond their capacity.</p>

<p>It is only irredeemable paper&mdash;irredeemable in
whole or in part,&mdash;that ever <i>appears</i> to inflate prices,
relatively to gold. But that it really causes no inflation
of prices, relatively to gold, is proved by the fact
that it no more inflates the prices of other property,
than it does the price of gold itself. Thus we say that
irredeemable paper, that is worth but fifty cents on the
dollar, inflates the prices of commodities in general to
twice their real value. By this we mean, that they are
inflated to twice their value relatively to gold. And
why do we say this? Solely because it takes twice as
many of these irredeemable paper dollars to buy any
commodity,&mdash;a barrel of flour for example,&mdash;as it
would if the paper were equal in value to gold. But it
also takes twice as many of these irredeemable paper
dollars to buy gold itself, as it would if the paper were
equal in value to gold. There is, therefore, just as
much reason for saying that the paper inflates the
price of gold, as there is for saying that it inflates the
price of flour. It inflates neither. It is, itself, worth
but fifty cents on the dollar; and it, therefore, takes
twice as much of it to buy either flour or gold, as it
would if the paper were of equal value with gold.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>The value of the coins&mdash;in any nation that is open
to free commerce with the rest of the world&mdash;is fixed
by their value in the markets of the world; and can
neither be reduced below that value, in that nation, by
any possible amount of paper currency, nor raised
above that value, by the entire disuse of a paper currency.
Any increase of the currency, therefore, by
means of paper representing other property than the
coins&mdash;but having an equal value with the coins&mdash;is
an absolute <i>bona fide</i> increase of the currency to that
extent; and not a mere depreciation of it, as so many
are in the habit of asserting.</p>

<p>Practically and commercially speaking, a dollar is
not necessarily a specific thing, made of silver, or gold,
or any other single metal, or substance. <i>It is only
such a quantum of market value as exists in a given
piece of silver or gold.</i> And it is the same quantum
of value, whether it exist in gold, silver, houses, lands,
cattle, horses, wool, cotton, wheat, iron, coal, or any
other commodity that men desire for use, and buy and
sell in the market.</p>

<p>Every dollar's worth of vendible property in the
world is equal in value to a dollar in gold. And if it
were possible that every dollar's worth of such property,
in the world, could be represented, in the market,
by a contract on paper, promising to deliver it on demand;
and if every dollar's worth could be delivered
on demand, in redemption of the paper that represented
it, the world could then have an amount of currency
equal to the entire property of the world. And yet
clearly every dollar of paper would be equal in value<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
to a dollar of gold; specie payments&mdash;or the literal
fulfilment of contracts&mdash;could forever be maintained;
and yet there could be no inflation of prices, relatively
to gold. Such a currency would no more inflate the
price of one thing, than of another. It would as much
inflate the price of gold, as of any thing else. Gold
would stand at its true and natural value as a metal;
and all other things would also stand at their true and
natural values, for their respective uses.</p>

<p>On this principle, if every dollar's worth of vendible
property in the United States could be represented by
a paper currency; and if the property could all be delivered
on demand, in redemption of the paper, such a
currency would not inflate the prices of property at all,
relatively to gold. Gold would still stand at its true
and natural value as a metal, or at its value in the
markets of the world. And all the property represented
by the paper, would simply be measured by the
gold, and would stand at its true and natural value,
relatively to the gold.</p>

<p>We could then have some thirty thousand millions
($30,000,000,) of paper currency,&mdash;taking our property
at its present valuation. And yet every dollar of
it would be equal to a dollar of gold; and there could
evidently be no inflation of prices, relatively to gold.
No more of the currency could be kept in circulation,
than should be necessary or convenient for the purchase
and sale of property at specie prices.</p>

<p>It is probably not practicable to represent the entire
property of the country by such contracts on paper as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
would be convenient and acceptable as a currency.
This is especially true of the <i>personal</i> property;
although large portions even of this are being constantly
represented by such contracts as bank notes,
private promissory notes, checks, drafts, and bills of
exchange; all of which are in the nature of currency;
that is, they serve for the time as a substitute for specie;
although some of them do not acquire any extensive,
or even general, circulation.</p>

<p>But that it is perfectly practicable to represent
nearly all the <i>real estate</i> of the country&mdash;including
the railroads&mdash;by such contracts on paper as will be
perfectly convenient and acceptable as a currency; and
that every dollar of it can be kept always at par with
specie throughout the entire country&mdash;that all this is
perfectly practicable, the author offers the system
already presented in proof.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> 2.</h4>

<p>To sustain their theory, that an abundant paper
currency&mdash;though equal in value to gold&mdash;inflates
prices, relatively to gold, its advocates assert that, <i>for
the time being</i>, the paper depreciates the gold itself
below its true value; or at least below that value
which it had before the paper was introduced. But
this is an impossibility; for in a country open to free
commerce with the rest of the world, gold must always
have the same value that it has in the markets of the
world; neither more, nor less. No possible amount of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
paper can reduce it below that value; as has been
abundantly demonstrated in this country for the last
ten years. Neither can any possible amount of paper
currency reduce gold below its only true and natural
value, viz.: its value as a metal, for uses in the arts.
The paper cannot reduce the gold below this value,
because the paper does not come at all in competition
with it for those uses. We cannot make a watch, a
spoon, or a necklace, out of the paper; and therefore
the paper cannot compete with the gold for these uses.</p>

<p>That gold and silver now have, and can be made to
have, no higher value, as a currency, than they have
as metals for uses in the arts, is proved by the fact
that doubtless not more than one tenth, and very likely
not more than a twentieth, of all the gold and silver in
the world (out of the mines), is in circulation as currency.
In Asia, where these metals have been accumulating
from time immemorial, and whither all the
gold and silver of Europe and America&mdash;except what
is caught up, and converted into plate, jewelry, &amp;c.&mdash;is
now going, and has been going for the last two
thousand years, very little is in circulation as money.
For the common traffic of the people, coins made of
coarser metals, shells, and other things of little value,
are the only currency. It is only for the larger commercial
transactions, that gold and silver are used at
all as a currency. The great bulk of these metals are
used for plate, jewelry, for embellishing temples and
palaces. Large amounts are also hoarded.</p>

<p>But that gold and silver coins now stand, and that
they can be made to stand, as currency, only at their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
true and natural values as metals, for uses in the arts;
and that neither the use, nor disuse, of any possible
amount of paper currency, in any one country&mdash;the
United States, for example&mdash;can sensibly affect their
values in that country, or raise them above, or reduce
them below, their values in the markets of the world,
the author hopes to demonstrate more fully at a future
time, if it should be necessary to do so.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> 3.</h4>

<p>Another argument&mdash;or rather assertion&mdash;of those
who say that any increase of the currency, by means
of paper&mdash;though the paper be equal in value to
gold&mdash;depreciates the value of the gold, or inflates
prices relatively to gold, is this: They assert that,
where no other circumstances intervene to affect the
prices of particular commodities, such increase of the
currency raises the prices of <i>all</i> kinds of property&mdash;relatively
to gold&mdash;in a degree precisely corresponding
with the increase of the currency.</p>

<p>This is the universal assertion of those who oppose a
<i>solvent</i> paper currency; or a paper currency that is
equal in value to gold.</p>

<p>But the assertion itself is wholly <i>untrue</i>. It is
wholly <i>untrue</i> that an abundant paper currency&mdash;that
is equal in value to gold&mdash;raises the prices of <i>all</i> commodities&mdash;relatively
to gold&mdash;in a proportion corresponding
to the increase of the currency. <i>Instead of
doing so, it causes a rise only in agricultural commodities,
and real estate; while it causes a great fall in the
prices of manufactures generally.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the increased currency produces <i>a directly
opposite effect</i> upon the prices of agricultural commodities
and real estate, on the one hand, and upon manufactures,
on the other.</p>

<p>The reasons are these:</p>

<p>Agriculture requires but very few exchanges, and
can, therefore, be carried on with very little money.
Manufactures, on the other hand, require a great many
exchanges, and can, therefore, be carried on (except in
a very feeble way), only by the aid of a great deal of
money.</p>

<p>The consequence is, that the people of all those
nations, that have but little money, are engaged mostly
in agriculture. Very few of them are manufacturers.
Being mostly engaged in agriculture, each one producing
the same commodities with nearly all the others;
and each one producing all he wants for his own consumption,
there is no market, or very little market, for
agricultural commodities; and such commodities, consequently,
bear only a very small price.</p>

<p>Manufactured commodities, on the other hand, are
very scarce and dear, for the sole reason that so few
persons are engaged in producing them.</p>

<p>But let there be an increase of currency, and laborers
at once leave agriculture, and become manufacturers.</p>

<p>As manufactured commodities usually bring much
higher prices than agricultural, in proportion to the
labor it costs to produce them, men usually leave agriculture,
and go into manufacturing, to the full extent
the increased currency will allow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>The consequence is that, under an abundant currency,
manufactures become various, abundant, and
cheap; where before they were scarce and dear.</p>

<p>But while, on the one hand, manufactures are thus
becoming various, abundant, and cheap, agricultural
commodities, on the other hand, are rising: and why?
Not because the currency is depreciated, but simply
because so many persons, who before&mdash;under a scanty
currency&mdash;were engaged in agriculture, and produced
all the agricultural commodities they needed, and perhaps
more than they needed, for their own consumption,
having now left agriculture, and become manufacturers,
have become purchasers and consumers, instead
of producers, of agricultural commodities.</p>

<p>Here the same cause&mdash;abundant currency&mdash;that
has occasioned a <i>rise</i> in the prices of agricultural commodities,
has produced a <i>directly opposite effect</i> upon
manufactures. It has made the latter various, abundant,
and cheap; where before they were scarce and
dear.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when the currency contracts,
manufacturing industry is in a great degree stopped;
and the persons engaged in it are driven to agriculture
as their only means of sustaining life. The consequence
is, that manufactured commodities become
scarce and dear, from non-production. At the same
time, agricultural commodities become superabundant
and cheap, from over-production and want of a market.</p>

<p>Thus an abundant currency, and a scanty currency,
produce directly opposite effects upon the prices of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
agricultural commodities, on the one hand, and manufactures,
on the other.</p>

<p>The <i>abundant</i> currency makes manufactures various,
abundant, and cheap, from increased production; while
it raises the prices of agricultural commodities, by
withdrawing laborers from the production of them, and
also by creating a body of purchasers and consumers,
to wit, the manufacturers.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a <i>scanty</i> currency drives men
from manufactures into agriculture, and thus causes
manufactures to become scarce and dear, from non-production;
and, at the same time, causes agricultural
commodities to fall in price, from over-production, and
want of a market.</p>

<p>But whether, on the one hand, agricultural commodities
are rising, and manufactured commodities are falling,
under an abundant currency; or whether, on the
other hand, manufactured commodities are rising, and
agricultural commodities are falling, under a scanty
currency, the value of the currency itself, dollar for
dollar, remains the same in both cases.</p>

<p>The value of the currency, in either of these cases;
is fixed, not at all by the amount in circulation, but by
its value relatively to gold. And the value of gold, in
any particular country, is fixed by its value as a metal,
and its value in the markets of the world; and not at
all by any greater or less quantity of paper that may
be in circulation in that country.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> 4.</h4>

<p>But it is not alone agricultural <i>products</i> that rise in
price under an abundant currency. Real estate also,
of all kinds&mdash;agricultural, manufacturing, and commercial&mdash;rises
under an abundant currency, and falls
under a scanty currency. The reasons are these:</p>

<p><i>Agricultural</i> real estate rises under an abundant currency,
because agricultural products rise under such a
currency, as already explained. <i>Manufacturing</i> real
estate rises under an abundant currency, simply because&mdash;money
being the great instrumentality of manufacturing
industry&mdash;that industry is active and profitable
under an abundant currency. <i>Commercial</i> real estate
rises under an abundant currency, because, under such
a currency, commerce, the exchange and distribution
of agricultural and manufactured commodities, is active
and profitable. <i>Railroads</i>, also, rise under an abundant
currency, because, under such a currency, the
transportation of freight and passengers is increased.</p>

<p>On the other hand, all kinds of real estate fall in
price under a scanty currency, for these reasons, to wit:
Agricultural real estate falls, because, manufactures
having been in a great measure stopped, and the manufacturers
driven into agriculture, there is little market
for agricultural products, and those products bring only
a small price. Manufacturing real estate falls, because,
manufacturing industry having become impossible for
lack of money, manufacturing real estate is lying dead,
or unproductive. Commercial real estate falls, because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
commerce, the exchange and distribution of agricultural
and manufactured commodities, has ceased. Railroads
fall in price, because, owing to the suspension of manufactures
and commerce, there is little transportation of
either freight or passengers.</p>

<p>Thus it will be seen that an abundant currency
creates a great rise in agricultural products, and in all
kinds of real estate&mdash;agricultural, manufacturing, and
commercial, (including railroads); and, at the same
time, causes manufactured commodities to become
various, abundant, and cheap. While, on the other
hand, a scanty currency causes agricultural commodities,
and all kinds of real estate, to fall in price; and,
at the same time, makes manufactured commodities
scarce and dear.</p>

<p>It is a particularly noticeable fact, that those who
claim that an abundant paper currency inflates the
prices of <i>all</i> commodities, relatively to gold, never find
it convenient to speak of the variety, abundance, and
cheapness of manufactures, that exist under an abundant
currency; but only of the high prices of agricultural
commodities, and real estate.</p>

<p>The whole subject of prices&mdash;a subject that is very
little understood, and that has been forever misrepresented,
in order to justify restraints upon the currency,
and keep it in a few hands&mdash;deserves a more extensive
discussion; but the special purposes of this pamphlet
do not admit of it here. But enough has probably
now been said, to show that the great changes that
take place in prices, under an abundant currency, on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
the one hand, and a scanty currency, on the other, are
not occasioned at all by any change in the value of the
currency itself&mdash;dollar for dollar&mdash;provided the currency
be equal in value to coin.</p>

<p>Enough, also, it is hoped, has been said, to show to
all holders of either agricultural, manufacturing, or
commercial real estate (including railroads), that the
greater or less value of their property depends almost
wholly upon the abundance or scarcity of currency;
and that, inasmuch as, under the system proposed,
they have the power, in their own hands, of creating
probably all the currency that can possibly be used in
manufactures and commerce, they have no one but
themselves to blame, if they suffer the value of their
property to be destroyed by any such narrow and
tyrannical systems of currency and credit as those that
now prevail, or those that have always heretofore
prevailed.</p>

<p>By using their real estate as banking capital, they
can not only get an income from it, in the shape of
interest on money, but by supplying capital to mechanics
and merchants, they create a large class who will
pay high prices for agricultural products, and high
prices and rents for manufacturing and commercial
real estate; and who will also supply them, in return,
with manufactured commodities of the greatest variety,
abundance, and cheapness.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, mere suicide for the holders of real
estate, who have the power of supplying an indefinite
amount of capital for mechanics and merchants&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
who can make themselves and everybody else rich by
supplying it&mdash;to suffer that power to be usurped by
any such small body of men as those who now monopolize
it, through mere favoritism, corruption, and
tyranny, on the part of the government, and not
because they have any claim to it.</p>

<h3>SECURITY OF THE SYSTEM.</h3>


<p>Supposing the property mortgaged to be ample, the
system, as a system, is absolutely secure. The currency
would be absolutely incapable of insolvency;
for there could never be a dollar of the currency in circulation,
without a dollar of capital (Productive Stock)
in bank, which <i>must</i> be transferred in redemption of
it, unless redemption be made in specie.</p>

<p>The capital <i>alone</i>, be it observed&mdash;independently of
the notes discounted&mdash;must always be sufficient to
redeem the entire circulation; for the circulation can
never exceed the capital (Productive Stock). But the
notes discounted are also holden by the trustees, and
the proceeds of them must be applied to the redemption
of the circulation. Supposing, therefore, the capital
to be sufficient, and the notes discounted to be
solvent, the redemption of the circulation is doubly
secured.</p>

<p>What guarantee, then, have the public, for the sufficiency
of the mortgages? They have these, viz.:</p>

<p>1. The mortgages, composing the capital of a bank,
will be matters of public record, and everybody, <i>in the
neighborhood</i>, will have the means of judging for himself
of the sufficiency of the property holden. If the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
property should be insufficient, the bank would be discredited
at once; for the abundance of solvent currency
would be so great, that no one would have
any inducement to take that which was insolvent or
doubtful.</p>

<p>2. By the Articles of Association, all the mortgages
that make up the capital of a bank, are made mutually
responsible for each other; because, if any one mortgage
proves insufficient, no dividend can afterwards be
paid to any of the bankers (mortgagors), until that
deficiency shall have been made good by the company.
The effect of this provision will be, to make all the
founders of a bank look carefully to the sufficiency of
each other's mortgages; because no man will be willing
to put in a good mortgage of his own, on equal
terms with a bad mortgage of another man's, when he
knows that his own mortgage will have to contribute
to making good any deficiency of the other. The
result will be, that the mortgages, that go to make up
the capital of any one bank, <i>will be either all good, or
all bad</i>. If they are <i>all good</i>, the solvency of the
bank will be apparent to all <i>in the vicinity</i>; and the
credit of the bank will at once be established <i>at home</i>.
If the mortgages are <i>all bad</i>, that fact, also, will be
apparent to everybody <i>in the vicinity</i>, and the bank is
at once discredited <i>at home</i>.</p>

<p>From the foregoing considerations, it is evident that
nothing is easier than for a <i>good</i> bank to establish its
credit, <i>at home</i>; and that nothing is more certain than
that a <i>bad</i> bank would be discredited, <i>at home</i>, from
the outset, and could get no circulation at all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>It is also evident that a bank, that has no credit at
home, could get none abroad. There is, therefore, no
danger of the public being swindled by bad banks.</p>

<p>A bank that is well founded, and that has established
its credit at home, has so many ways of establishing
its credit abroad, that there is no need that
they be all specified here. The mode that seems most
likely to be adopted, is the following, viz.:</p>

<p>When the capital shall consist of mortgages, it will
be very easy for all the banks, in any one State, to
make their solvency known <i>to each other</i>. There
would be so many banks, that some <i>system</i> would
naturally be adopted for this purpose.</p>

<p>Perhaps this system would be, that a standing committee,
appointed by the banks, would be established
in each State, to whom each bank in the State would
be required to produce satisfactory evidence of its solvency,
before its bills should be received by the other
banks of the State.</p>

<p>When the banks, or any considerable number of
the banks, of any particular State&mdash;Massachusetts,
for instance,&mdash;shall have made themselves so far
acquainted with each other's solvency, as to be ready
to receive each other's bills, they will be ready to
make a still further arrangement for their mutual benefit,
viz: To unite in establishing one general agency in
Boston, another in New York, and others in Philadelphia,
Baltimore, Cincinnati, Chicago, St. Louis, New
Orleans, San Francisco, &amp;c., &amp;c., where the bills of all
these Massachusetts banks would be redeemed, either<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
from a common fund contributed for the purpose, or in
such other way as might be found best. And thus the
bills of all the Massachusetts banks would be placed at
par at all the great commercial points.</p>

<p>Each bank, belonging to the association, might print
on the back of its bills, "<i>Redeemable at the Massachusetts
Agencies in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, &amp;c.</i>"</p>

<p>In this way, all the banks of each State might unite
to establish a joint agency in every large city, throughout
the country, for the redemption of all their bills.
In doing so, they would not only certify, but make
themselves responsible for, the solvency of each other's
bills.</p>

<p>The banks might safely make <i>permanent</i> arrangements
of this kind with each other; because the <i>permanent</i>
solvency of all the banks might be relied on.</p>

<p>The permanent solvency of all the banks might be
relied on, because, under this system, a bank (whose
capital consists of mortgages), once solvent, is necessarily
forever solvent, unless in contingencies so
utterly improbable as not to need to be taken into
account. In fact, in the ordinary course of things,
every bank would be growing more and more solvent;
because, in the ordinary course of things, the mortgaged
property would be constantly rising in value, as
the wealth and population of the country should
increase. The exceptions to this rule would be so rare
as to be unworthy of notice.</p>

<p>There is, therefore, no difficulty in putting the currency,
furnished by each State, at par throughout the
United States.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>At the general agencies, in the great cities, the
redemption would, doubtless, <i>so far as necessary</i>, be
made in specie, <i>on demand</i>; because, at such points,
especially in cities on the sea-board, there would
always be an abundance of specie in the market as
merchandise; and it would, therefore, be both for the
convenience and interest of the banks to redeem in
specie, on demand, rather than transfer a portion of
their capital, and then pay interest on that capital
until it should be redeemed, or bought back, with
specie.</p>

<p>Often, however, and very likely even in the great
majority of cases, a man from one State&mdash;as California,
for example,&mdash;presenting Massachusetts bills for
redemption at a Massachusetts agency&mdash;either in
Boston, New York, or elsewhere&mdash;would prefer to
have them redeemed with bills from his own State,
California, rather than with specie.</p>

<p>If the system were adopted throughout the United
States, the banks of each State would be likely to
have agencies of this kind in all the great cities. Each
of these agencies would exchange the bills of every
other State for the bills of its own State; and thus the
bills of each State would find their way home, without
any demand for their redemption in specie having ever
been made.</p>

<p>Where railroads were used as capital, all the banks
in the United States could form one association, of the
kind just mentioned, to establish agencies at all the
great commercial points, for the redemption of their
bills.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course each railroad would receive the bills of all
other roads, for fare and freight.</p>

<p>Thus all railroad currency, under this system, would
be put at par throughout the United States.</p>

<h3>THE SYSTEM AS A CREDIT SYSTEM.</h3>


<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> 1.</h4>

<p>Perhaps the merits of the system, as a credit system,
cannot be better illustrated than by comparing
the amount of loanable capital it is capable of supplying,
with the amount which the present "National"
banks (so called) are capable of supplying.</p>

<p>If we thus compare the two systems, we shall find
that the former is capable of supplying more than fifty
times as much credit as the latter.</p>

<p>Thus the entire circulation authorized by all the
"National" banks,<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> is but three hundred and fifty-four
millions of dollars ($354,000,000).</p>

<p>But the real estate and railroads of the country are
probably worth twenty thousand millions of dollars
($20,000,000,000). This latter sum is fifty-six times
greater than the former; and is all capable of being
loaned in the form of currency.</p>

<p>Calling the population of the country forty millions
(40,000,000), the "National" system is capable of
supplying not quite <i>nine</i> dollars ($9) of loanable capital<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
to each individual of the whole population. The
system proposed is capable of supplying five hundred
dollars ($500) of loanable capital to each individual
of the whole population.</p>

<p>Supposing one half the population (male and female)
to be sixteen years of age and upwards, and to be
capable of producing wealth, and to need capital for
their industry, the "National" system would furnish
not quite eighteen dollars ($18) for each one of them,
on an average. The other system is capable of furnishing
one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each one of them,
on an average.</p>

<p>Supposing the adults (both male and female) of the
country to be sixteen millions (16,000,000), the "National"
system is capable of furnishing only twenty-two
dollars and twelve and a half cents ($22.12&frac12;) to
each one of these persons, on an average. The system
proposed is capable of furnishing twelve hundred and
fifty dollars ($1,250) to each one, on an average.</p>

<p>Supposing the number of <i>male</i> adults in the whole
country to be eight millions (8,000,000), the "National"
system is capable of furnishing only forty-four
dollars and twenty-five cents ($44.25) to each one.
The other system is capable of furnishing twenty-five
hundred dollars ($2,500) to each one.</p>

<p>The present number of "National" banks is little
less than two thousand (2,000). Calling the number
two thousand (2,000), and supposing the $354,000,000
of circulation to be equally divided between them, each
bank would be authorized to issue $177,000.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>Under the proposed system, the real estate and railroads
of the country are capable of furnishing one hundred
thousand (100,000) banks, having each a capital
of two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000); or it is
capable of furnishing one hundred and twelve thousand
nine hundred and ninety-four (112,994) banks, having
each a capital ($177,000), equal, on an average, to the
capital of the present "National" banks. That is, this
system is capable of furnishing fifty-six times as many
banks as the "National" system, having each the same
capital, on an average, as the "National" banks.</p>

<p>Calling the number of the present "National" banks
two thousand (2,000), and the population of the country
forty millions (40,000,000), there is only one bank
to 20,000 people, on an average; each bank being
authorized to issue, on an average, a circulation of
$177,000.</p>

<p>Under the proposed system, we could have one bank
for every five hundred (500) persons; each bank being
authorized to issue $200,000; or $23,000 each more
than the "National" banks.</p>

<p>These figures give some idea of the comparative
capacity of the two systems to furnish credit.</p>

<p>Under which of these two systems, now, would
everybody, who needs credit, and deserves it, be most
likely to get it? And to get all he needs to make his
industry most productive? And to get it at the lowest
rates of interest?</p>

<p>The proposed system is as much superior to the old
specie paying system (so called)&mdash;in respect to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
amount of loanable capital it is capable of supplying&mdash;as
it is to the present "National" system.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> 2.</h4>

<p>But the proposed system has one other feature,
which is likely to be of great practical importance, and
which gives it a still further superiority&mdash;as a credit
system&mdash;over the so-called specie paying system. It
is this:</p>

<p>The old specie paying system (so called) could add
to the loanable capital of the country, <i>only by so much
currency as it could keep in circulation, over and above
the amount of specie that it was necessary to keep on
hand for its redemption</i>. But the amount of loanable
capital which the proposed system can supply, hardly
depends at all upon the amount of its currency that
can be kept in circulation. It can supply about the
same amount of loanable capital, even though its currency
should be returned for redemption immediately
after it is issued. It can do this, because the banks,
<i>by paying interest on the currency returned for redemption</i>&mdash;or,
what is the same thing, by paying dividends
on the <span class="smcap">Productive Stock</span> transferred in redemption of
the currency&mdash;can postpone the payment of specie to
such time as it shall be convenient for them to pay it.</p>

<p>All that would be necessary to make loans practicable
on this basis, would be, that the banks should
receive a higher rate of interest on their loans than
they would have to pay on the currency returned for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
redemption; that is, on the <span class="smcap">Productive Stock</span> transferred
in redemption of the currency.</p>

<p>The rate of interest <i>received</i> by the banks, on the
loans made by them, would need to be so much higher
than that <i>paid</i> by them, on currency returned for
redemption, as to make it an object for them to loan
more of their currency than could be kept in circulation.
Subject to this condition, the banks could loan
their entire capitals, whether much or little of it could
be kept in circulation.</p>

<p>For example, suppose the banks should pay <i>six</i> per
cent. interest on currency returned for redemption&mdash;(or
as dividends on the <span class="smcap">Productive Stock</span> transferred
in redemption of such currency)&mdash;they could then
loan their currency at <i>nine</i> per cent. and still make
<i>three</i> per cent. profits, even though the currency loaned
should come back for redemption immediately after it
was issued.</p>

<p>But this is not all. Even though the banks should
<i>pay</i>, on currency returned for redemption, precisely
the same rate of interest they <i>received</i> on loans&mdash;say
<i>six</i> per cent.&mdash;they could still do business, if their
currency should, on an average, continue in circulation
<i>one half the time for which it was loaned</i>; for then the
banks would get three per cent. net on their loans, and
this would make their business a paying one.</p>

<p>But the banks would probably do much better than
this; for bank credits would supersede all private
credits; and the diversity and amount of production
would be so great that an immense amount of currency<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
would be constantly required to make the necessary
exchanges. And whatever amount should be necessary
for making these exchanges, would, of course, remain
in circulation. However much currency, therefore,
should be issued, it is probable that, on an average, it
would remain in circulation more than half the time for
which it was loaned.</p>

<p>Or if the banks should pay <i>six</i> per cent. interest on
currency returned for redemption; and should then
loan money, for <i>six</i> months, at <i>eight</i> per cent. interest;
and this currency should remain in circulation but one
month; the banks would then get eight per cent. for
the one month, and two per cent. net for the other five
months; which would be equal to three per cent. for
the whole six months. Or if the currency should
remain in circulation two months, the banks would
then get eight per cent. for the two months, and two
per cent. net for the other four months; which would
be equal to four per cent. for the whole six months.
Or if the currency should remain in circulation three
months, the banks would then get eight per cent. for
three months, and two per cent. net for the other three
months; which would be equal to five per cent. for the
whole six months. Or if the currency should remain
in circulation four months, the banks would then get
eight per cent. for the four months, and two per cent.
net for the other two months; which would be equal to
six per cent. for the whole six months. Or if the currency
should remain in circulation five months, the
banks would then get eight per cent. for the five<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
months, and two per cent. net for the other month;
which would be equal to seven per cent. for the whole
six months.</p>

<p>The banks would soon ascertain, by experiment,
how long their currency was likely to remain in circulation;
and what rate of interest it was therefore
necessary for them to charge to make their business a
paying one. And that rate, whatever it might be, the
borrowers would have to pay. Subject to this condition,
the banks could always loan their entire capitals.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>AMOUNT OF CURRENCY NEEDED.</h3>


<p>It is of no use to say that we do not need so much
currency as the proposed system would supply;
because, first, if we should not need it, we shall not
use it. Every dollar of paper will represent specific
property that can be delivered on demand in redemption
of it, and that will have the same market value as
gold. The paper dollar, therefore, will have the same
market value as the gold dollar, or as a dollar's worth
of any other property; and no one will part with it,
unless he gets in exchange for it something that will
serve his particular wants better; and no one will
accept it, unless it will serve his particular wants better
than the thing he parts with. No more paper,
therefore, can circulate, than is wanted for the purchase
and sale of commodities at their true and natural
values, as measured by gold.</p>

<p>Secondly, we do not know at all how much currency
we do need. That is something that can be determined
only by experiment. We know that, heretofore,
whenever currency has been increased, industry
and traffic have increased to a corresponding extent.
And they would unquestionably increase to an extent
far beyond any thing the world has ever seen, if only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
they were aided and permitted by an adequate currency.</p>

<p>We, as yet, know very little what wealth mankind
are capable of creating. It is only within a hundred
years, or a little more, that any considerable portion of
them have really begun to invent machinery, and
learned that it is only by machinery that they can
create any considerable wealth. But they have not
yet learned&mdash;at least, they profess not to have learned&mdash;that
money is indispensable to the practical employment
of machinery; that it is as impossible to operate
machinery without money, as it is to operate it without
wind, water, or steam. When they shall have learned,
and practically accepted, this great fact, and shall have
provided themselves with money, wealth will speedily
become universal. And it is only those who would
deplore such a result, or those who are too stupid to
see the palpable and necessary connection between
money and manufacturing industry, who resist the
indefinite increase of money.</p>

<p>It is scarcely a more patent fact that land is the
indispensable capital for agricultural industry, than it
is that money is the indispensable capital for manufacturing
industry. Practically, everybody recognizes
this fact, and virtually acknowledges it; although, in
words, so many deny it. Men as deliberately and
accurately calculate the amount of machinery that a
hundred dollars in money will operate, as they do the
amount of machinery that a ton of coal, or a given
amount of water, will operate. They calculate much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
more accurately the amount of manufactured goods a
hundred dollars will produce, than they do the amount
of grain, grass, or vegetables an acre of land will produce.
They no more expect to see mechanics carrying
on business for themselves without money, than they
do to see agricultural laborers carrying on farming
without land, or than they do to see sailors going to
sea without ships. They know that all mechanical, as
well as agricultural, laborers, who have not the appropriate
capital for their special business, must necessarily
stand idle, or become mere wage-laborers for
others, at such particular employments as the latter
may dictate, and at such prices as the latter may see
fit to pay.</p>

<p>All these things attest the perfect knowledge that
men have, that a money capital is indispensable to
manufacturing industry; whatever assertions they may
make to the contrary.</p>

<p>They know, therefore, that prohibitions upon money
are prohibitions upon industry itself; that there can
be no such thing as freedom of industry, where there
is not freedom to lend and hire capital for such
industry.</p>

<p>Every one knows, too&mdash;who knows any thing at all
on such a subject&mdash;that it is, intrinsically, as flagrant
a tyranny, as flagrant a violation of men's natural
rights, for a government to forbid the lending and hiring
of money for manufacturing industry, as it is to
forbid the lending and hiring of land, or agricultural
implements, for agricultural industry, or the lending<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
and hiring of ships for maritime industry. They know
that it is as flagrant a tyranny, as flagrant a violation of
men's natural rights, to forbid one man to lend another
money for mechanical industry, as it would be to forbid
the former to lend the latter a house to live in, a
shop to work in, or tools to work with.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, a flagrant, manifest tyranny, a flagrant,
manifest violation of men's natural rights, to
lay any conditions or restrictions whatever upon the
business of banking&mdash;that is, upon the lending and
hiring of money&mdash;except such as are laid upon all
other transactions between man and man, viz.: the
fulfilment of contracts, and restraints upon force and
fraud.</p>

<p>A man who is without capital, and who, by prohibitions
upon banking, is practically forbidden to hire
any, is in a condition elevated but one degree above that
of a chattel slave. He may live; but he can live only as
the servant of others; compelled to perform such labor,
and to perform it at such prices, as they may see fit to
dictate. And a government, which, at this day, subjects
the great body of the people&mdash;or even any portion
of them&mdash;to this condition, is as fit an object of
popular retribution as any tyranny that ever existed.</p>

<p>To deprive mankind of their natural right and power
of creating wealth for themselves, is as great a tyranny
as it is to rob them of it after they have created it.
And this is done by all laws against honest banking.</p>

<p>All these things are so self-evident, so universally
known, that no man, of ordinary mental capacity, can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
claim to be ignorant of them. And any legislator,
who disregards them, should be taught, by a discipline
short, sharp, and decisive, that his power is wholly
subordinate to the natural rights of mankind.</p>

<p>It is, then, one of man's indisputable, natural rights
to lend and hire capital in any and every form and
manner that is intrinsically honest. And as money, or
currency, is the great, the indispensable instrumentality
in the production and distribution of wealth; as it is
the capital, the motive power, that sets all other instrumentalities
in motion; as it is the one thing, without
which all the other great agencies of production&mdash;such
as science, skill, and machinery&mdash;are practically paralyzed;
to say that we need no more of it, and shall
have no more of it, than we now have, is to say that
we need no more wealth, and shall have no more
wealth, and no more equal or equitable distribution of
wealth, than we now have. It is to say that the mass
of mankind&mdash;the laborers, the producers of wealth&mdash;need
not to produce, and shall not be permitted to produce,
wealth for themselves, but only for others.</p>

<p>For a government to limit the currency of a people,
and to designate the individuals (or corporations) who
shall have the control of that currency, is, manifestly,
equivalent to saying there shall be but so much industry
and wealth in the nation, and that these shall be
under the special control, and for the special enjoyment,
of the individuals designated; and, of course,
that all other persons shall be simply their dependants
and servants; receiving only such prices for their prop<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>erty,
and such compensation for their labor, as these
few holders of the currency shall see fit to give for
them.</p>

<p>The effect of these prohibitions upon money, and
consequently upon industry, are everywhere apparent
in the poverty of the great body of the people.</p>

<p>At the present time, the people of this country certainly
do not produce one third, very likely not one
fifth, of the wealth they might produce. And the
little they do produce is all in the hands of a few.
All this is attributable to the want of currency and
credit, and to the consequent want of science, skill,
machinery, and working capital.</p>

<p>Of the twenty million persons, male and female, of
sixteen years of age and upwards&mdash;capable of producing
wealth&mdash;certainly not one in five has the
science, skill, implements, machinery, and capital necessary
to make his or her industry most effective; or to
secure to himself or herself the greatest share in the
products of his or her own industry. A very large
proportion of these persons&mdash;nearly all the females,
and a great majority of the males&mdash;persons capable
of running machinery, and of producing each three,
five, or ten dollars of wealth per day, are now without
science, skill, machinery, or capital, and are either producing
nothing, or working only with such inferior
means, and at such inferior employments, as to make
their industry of scarcely any value at all, either to
themselves or others, beyond the provision of the
coarsest necessaries of a hard and coarse existence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
And this is all owing to the lack of money; or rather
to the lack of money and credit.</p>

<p>There are, doubtless, in the country, ten million
(10,000,000) persons, male and female&mdash;sixteen years
of age and upwards&mdash;who are naturally capable of
creating from three to five dollars of wealth per day,
if they had the science, skill, machinery, and capital
which they ought to have, and might have; but who,
from the want of these, are now creating not more
than one dollar each per day, on an average; thus
occasioning a loss, to themselves and the country of
from twenty to forty millions of dollars per day, for
three hundred days in a year; a sum equal to from six
to twelve thousand millions per annum; or three to
six times the amount of our entire national debt.</p>

<p>And there are another ten million of persons&mdash;better
supplied, indeed, with capital, machinery, &amp;c., than
the ten million before mentioned&mdash;but who, nevertheless,
from the same causes, are producing far less than
they might.</p>

<p>The aggregate loss to the country, from these
causes, is, doubtless, equal to from ten to fifteen thousand
millions per year; or five, six, or seven times the
amount of the entire national debt.</p>

<p>In this estimate no account is taken of the loss suffered
from our inability&mdash;owing simply to a want of
money&mdash;to bring to this country, and give employment
to, the millions of laborers, in Europe and Asia,
who desire to come here, and add the products of their
labor to our national wealth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>It is, probably, no more than a reasonable estimate
to suppose that the nation, as a nation, is losing twenty
thousand millions of dollars ($20,000,000,000) per
annum&mdash;about ten times the amount of our national
debt&mdash;solely for the want of money to give such employment
as they need, to the population we now have,
and to those who desire to come here from other
countries.</p>

<p>Among the losses we suffer, from the causes mentioned,
the non-production of new inventions is by no
means the least. As a general rule, new inventions
are made only where money and machinery prevail.
And they are generally produced in a ratio corresponding
with the amount of money and machinery. In no
part of the country are the new inventions equal in
number to what they ought to be, and might be. In
three fourths of the country very few are produced.
In some, almost none at all. The losses from this
cause cannot be estimated in money.</p>

<p>The government, in its ignorance, arrogance, and
tyranny, either does not see all this, or, seeing it, does
not regard it. While these thousands of millions are
being lost annually, from the suppression of money,
and consequently of industry, and while three fourths
of the laborers of the country are either standing idle,
or, for the want of capital, are producing only a mere
fraction of what they might produce, a two-pence-ha'-penny
Secretary of the Treasury can find no better
employment for his faculties, than in trying, first, to
reduce the rate of interest on the public debt one per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
cent.&mdash;thereby saving twenty millions a year, <i>or fifty
cents for each person, on an average</i>! And, secondly,
in paying one hundred millions per annum of the principal;
that is, <i>two and a half dollars for each person,
on an average</i>! And he insists that the only way to
achieve these astounding results, is to deprive the people
at large of money! To destroy, as far as possible,
their industry! To deprive them, as far as possible, of
all power to manufacture for themselves! And to compel
them to pay, to the few manufacturers it has under
its protection, fifty or one hundred per cent. more for
their manufactures than they are worth!</p>

<p>He has been tugging at this tremendous task four
years, or thereabouts. And he confidently believes
that if he can be permitted to enforce this plan for a
sufficient period of years, in the future, he will ultimately
be able to save the people, annually, <i>fifty cents
each, on an average, in interest</i>! and also continue to
pay, annually, <i>two dollars and a half for each person,
on an average</i>, of the principal, of the national debt!</p>

<p>He apparently does not know, or, if he knows, it is,
in his eyes, a matter of comparatively small moment,
that this saving of $20,000,000 per annum in interest,
and this payment of $100,000,000 per annum of principal,
which he proposes to make on behalf of the
people, are not equal to what <i>two days</i>&mdash;or perhaps
even <i>one day</i>&mdash;of their industry would amount to, if
they were permitted to enjoy their natural rights of
lending and hiring capital, and producing such wealth
as they please for themselves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>He apparently does not know, or, if he knows, it is
with him a small matter, that if the people were permitted
to enjoy their natural freedom in currency and
credit, and consequently their natural freedom in industry,
they could pay the entire national debt three,
four, or a half dozen times over <i>every year</i>, more easily
than they can save the $20,000,000, and pay the
$100,000,000, annually, by the process that he adopts
for saving and paying them.</p>

<p>And yet this man, and his policy, represent the government
and its policy. The president keeps him in
office, and Congress sustain him in his measures.</p>

<p>In short, the government not only does not offer, but
is apparently determined not to suffer, any such thing
as freedom in currency and credit, or, consequently, in
industry. It is, apparently, so bent upon compelling
the people to give more for its few irredeemable notes
than they are worth; and so bent upon keeping all
wealth, and all means of wealth, in the hands of the
few&mdash;upon whose money and frauds it relies for support&mdash;that
it is determined, if possible, to perpetuate
this state of things indefinitely. And it will probably
succeed in perpetuating it indefinitely&mdash;under cover
of such false pretences as those of specie payments,
inflation of prices, reducing the interest, and paying the
principal, of the national debt, &amp;c.&mdash;unless the people
at large shall open their eyes to the deceit and robbery
that are practised upon them; and, by establishing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
freedom in currency and credit&mdash;and thereby freedom
in industry and commerce&mdash;end at once and forever
the tyranny that impoverishes and enslaves them.</p>

<h3>IMPORTANCE OF THE SYSTEM TO MASSACHUSETTS.</h3>


<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> 1.</h4>

<p>The tariffs, by means of which a few monied men
of Massachusetts have so long plundered the rest of
the country, and on which they have so largely relied
for their prosperity, will not much longer be endured.
The nation at large has no need of tariffs. Money is
the great instrumentality for manufacturing. And the
nation needs nothing but an ample supply of money&mdash;in
addition to its natural advantages&mdash;to enable
our people to manufacture for themselves much more
cheaply than any other people can manufacture for us.</p>

<p>To say nothing of the many millions who, if we had
the money necessary to give them employment, might
be brought here from Europe and Asia, and employed
in manufactures, more than half the productive power
of our present population&mdash;in the South and West
much more than half&mdash;is utterly lost for the want of
money, and the consequent want of science, skill, and
machinery. And yet those few, who monopolize the
present stock of money, insist that they must have
tariffs to enable them to manufacture at all. And the
nation is duped by these false pretences.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>To give bounties to encourage manufactures, and at
the same time forbid all but a favored few to have
money to manufacture with, is just as absurd as it
would be to give bounties to encourage manufactures,
and at the same time forbid all but a favored few to
have machinery of any kind to manufacture with. It
is just as absurd as it would be to give bounties to
encourage agriculture, and at the same time forbid all
but a favored few to own land, or have cattle, horses,
seed corn, seed wheat, or agricultural implements. It
is just as absurd as it would be to give bounties to
encourage navigation, and at the same time forbid all
but a favored few to have ships.</p>

<p>The whole object of such absurdities and tyrannies
is to commit the double wrong of depriving the mass
of the people of all power to manufacture for themselves,
and at the same time compel them to pay extortionate
prices to the favored few who are permitted to
manufacture.</p>

<p>When tariffs shall be abolished, Massachusetts will
have no means of increasing her prosperity, nor even
of perpetuating such poor prosperity as she now has,<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a>
except by a great increase of money; such an increase
of money as will enable her skilled laborers and enterprising
young men to get capital for such industries
and enterprises as they may prefer to engage in here,
rather than go elsewhere.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>
<p>Even if Massachusetts were willing to manufacture
for the South and West, <i>without a tariff</i>, she could
hope to do so only until the South and West should
supply themselves with money. So soon as they shall
supply themselves with money, they will be able to
manufacture for themselves more cheaply than Massachusetts
can manufacture for them. Their natural
advantages for manufacturing are greatly superior to
those of Massachusetts. They have the cheap food,
coal, iron, lead, copper, wool, cotton, hides, &amp;c., &amp;c.
They lack only money to avail themselves of these
advantages. And, under the system proposed, their
lands and railroads are capable of supplying all the
money they need. And they will soon adopt that, or
some other system. And they will then not only be
independent of Massachusetts, but will be able to draw
away from her her skilled laborers, and enterprising
young men, unless she shall first supply them with the
money capital necessary for such industries and enterprises
as may induce them to remain. They will, of
course, go where they can get capital, instead of staying
where they can get none.</p>

<p>So great are the natural advantages of the South
and West over those of Massachusetts, that it is doubtful
how many of these men can be persuaded to
remain, by all the inducements that capital can offer.
But without such inducements it is certain they will
all go.</p>

<p>And Massachusetts has no means of supplying this
needed money, except by using her real estate as
banking capital.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>
<p>It is, therefore, plainly a matter of life or death to
the holders of real estate in Massachusetts to use it for
that purpose; for their real estate will be worth nothing
when the skilled labor and the enterprising young
men of Massachusetts shall have deserted her.</p>

<p>All this is so manifest as to need no further demonstration.
And Massachusetts will do well to look the
facts in the face before it is too late.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> 2.</h4>

<p>What prospect has Massachusetts under the present
"National" system?</p>

<p>The Comptroller of the Currency, in his last annual
report, says, that of the $354,000,000 of circulation
authorized by law, Massachusetts has now $58,506,686.
He says, further, that this is more than four times as
much as she would be entitled to, if the currency were
apportioned equally among the States, according to
population; more than twice as much as she would be
entitled to, if the circulation were apportioned among
the States, according to their wealth; and three times
as much as she is entitled to upon an apportionment
made&mdash;as apportionments are now professedly made&mdash;half
upon population, and half upon wealth.</p>

<p>The Comptroller further says, that a law of Congress,
passed July 12, 1870, requiring him to withdraw circulation
from those States having more than their just
proportion, and to distribute it among those now having
less than their just proportion, will require him to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
withdraw "from thirty-six banks in the City of Boston,
$11,403,000; [and] from fifty-three country banks of
Massachusetts, $2,997,000."</p>

<p>Thus the law requires $14,400,000 to be withdrawn
from the present banks of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>When this shall have been done, she will have but
$44,106,686 left. And as this will be more than three
times her just proportion on a basis of population, and
nearly twice her just share on a basis of wealth, there
is no knowing how soon the remaining excess over her
just share may be withdrawn.<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></p>

<p>By the census of 1870, Massachusetts had a population
of 1,457,351. She has now, doubtless, a population
of 1,500,000. Calling her population 1,500,000,
the $58,506,686 of circulation which she now has, is
equal to $39 for each person, on an average. When
$14,400,000 of this amount shall have been withdrawn,
as the law now requires it to be, the circulation will be
reduced to less than $30 for each person, on an average.
If the circulation should be reduced to the proportion
to which Massachusetts is entitled, on the basis
of wealth&mdash;that is, to $25,098,600&mdash;she will then
have less than $17 for each person, on an average.
If the circulation should be reduced to the proportion
to which Massachusetts is entitled on a basis of population&mdash;that
is to $13,879,778&mdash;she will then have a
trifle less than $9 for each person, on an average.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>For years the industry of Massachusetts has been
greatly crippled for the want of bank credits, although
her banks have been authorized to issue their notes to
the amount of $58,506,686; or $39 to each person, on
an average. What will her industry be when her
banks shall be authorized to issue only $44,106,686, or
$30 for each person, on an average? What will it be,
if her bank issues shall be reduced to her proportion on
a basis of wealth, to wit, $25,098,600; or less than
$17 for each person, on an average? Or what will it
be, if her bank circulation shall be reduced to her proportion
on a basis of population, to wit, to $13,379,778;
or less than $9 for each person, on an average?</p>

<p>In contrast with such contemptible sums as these,
Massachusetts, under the system proposed, could have
nine hundred millions ($900,000,000) of bank loans;<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a>
that is, $600 for every man, woman, and child, on an
average; or $1,500 to each adult, male and female, on
an average; or $3,000 to each <i>male</i> adult, on an
average.</p>

<p>Which, now, of these two systems is most likely to
secure and increase the prosperity of Massachusetts?
Which is most likely to give to every deserving man
and woman in the State, the capital necessary to make
their industry most productive to themselves individually,
and to the State? Which system is most likely
to induce the skilled laborers and enterprising young
men of Massachusetts to remain here? And which is
most likely to drive them away?</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> 3.</h4>

<p>But the whole is not yet told. The present "National"
system is so burdened with taxes and other
onerous conditions, that no banking at all can be done
under it, except at rates of interest that are two or
three times as high as they ought to be; or as they
would be under the system proposed.</p>

<p>The burdens imposed on the present banks are probably
equal to from six to eight per cent. <i>upon the
amount of their own notes that they are permitted to
issue</i>.</p>

<p>In the first place, they are required, for every $90
of circulation, to invest $100 in five or six per cent.
government bonds.<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> This alone is a great burden to
all that class of persons who want their capital for
active business. It amounts to actual prohibition upon
all whose property is in real estate, and therefore not
convertible into bonds. And this is a purely tyrannical
provision, inasmuch as real estate is a much safer
and better capital than the bonds. Let us call this a
burden of <i>two per cent. on their circulation</i>.</p>

<p>Next, is the risk as to the permanent value of the
bonds. Any war, civil or foreign, would cause them to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
drop in value, as the frost causes the mercury to drop
in the thermometer. Even any danger of war would
at once reduce them in value. Let us call this risk
another burden of <i>one per cent. on the circulation</i>.</p>

<p>Next, every bank in seventeen or eighteen of the
largest cities&mdash;Boston among the number&mdash;are required
to keep on hand, at all times, a reserve&mdash;<i>in
dead capital</i> (legal tenders)&mdash;"equal to at least twenty-five
per centum," and all other banks a similar
reserve "equal to at least fifteen per centum," "of the
aggregate amount of their <i>notes in circulation, and of
their deposits</i>."</p>

<p>Doubtless, two thirds&mdash;very likely three fourths&mdash;of
all the bank circulation and deposits are in the
seventeen cities named. And as these city banks are
required to keep a reserve of dead capital equal to
twenty-five per cent., and all others a similar reserve
equal to fifteen per cent., <i>both on their circulation and
deposits</i>, this average burden on all the banks is,
doubtless, equal to <i>two per cent. on their circulation</i>.</p>

<p>Next, the banks are required to pay to the United
States an annual tax of one per cent. on their average
circulation, and half of one per cent. on the amount of
their deposits.</p>

<p>Here is another burden equal to at least <i>one and a
half per cent. on their circulation</i>.</p>

<p>Then the capitals of the banks&mdash;the United States
bonds&mdash;are made liable to State taxes to any extent,
"not at a greater rate than is assessed upon the monied
capital in the hands of individual citizens of such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
State." This tax is probably equal to <i>one per cent. on
their circulation</i>.</p>

<p>Here, then, are taxes and burdens equal to <i>seven and
a half per cent. on their circulation</i>.</p>

<p>Next, the banks are required to make at least <i>five</i>
reports annually, to the Comptroller of the Currency,
of their "resources and liabilities." Also reports of
"the amount of each dividend declared by the association."</p>

<p>Then, too, the banks are restricted as to the rates of
interest they are permitted to take.</p>

<p>Then "Congress may at any time alter, amend, or
repeal this act;" and thus impose upon the banks still
further taxes, conditions, restrictions, returns, and
reports. Or it may at pleasure abolish the banks
altogether.</p>

<p>All these taxes, burdens, and liabilities, cannot be
reckoned at less than <i>eight or nine per cent. on the circulation
of the banks</i>; a sum two or three times as
great as the rate of interest ought to be; and two or
three times as great as it would be under the system
proposed.</p>

<p>And yet the banks must submit to all these burdens
as a condition of being permitted to loan money at all.
And they must make up&mdash;in their rates of interest&mdash;for
all these burdens. Under this system, therefore,
the rate of interest must always be two or three times
as high as it ought to be.</p>

<p>The objections to the system, then, are, first, that it
furnishes very little loanable capital; and, second, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
it necessarily raises the interest on that little to two or
three times what it ought to be.</p>

<p>Such a system, obviously, could not be endured at
all, but for these reasons, viz.: first, that, being a
monopoly, those holding it are enabled to make enormous
extortions upon borrowers; and, secondly, that
these borrowers&mdash;most of whom are the bankers
themselves&mdash;employ the money in the manufacture
and sale of goods that are protected, by tariffs, from
foreign competition, and for which they are thus enabled
to get, say, fifty per cent. more than they are
worth.</p>

<p>In this way, these bank extortions and tariff extortions
are thrown ultimately upon the people who consume
the goods which the bank capital is employed in
producing and selling.</p>

<p>Thus the joint effect of the bank system and the
tariff is, first, to deprive the mass of the people of the
money capital that would enable them to manufacture
for themselves; and, secondly, to compel them to pay
extortionate prices for the few manufactures that are
produced.</p>

<p>Under the system proposed, all these things would
be done away. The West and the South, that are now
relied on to pay all these extortions, would manufacture
for themselves. Their lands and railroads would
enable them to supply all the manufacturing capital
that could be used. And they could supply it at one
half, or one third, the rates now required by the "National"
banks. Of course, Massachusetts could not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>&mdash;under
the "National" system&mdash;manufacture a dollar's
worth for the South and West. She could not keep
her manufacturing laborers. They would all go where
they could get cheap capital, cheap supplies, and good
markets. And then the manufacturing industry of
Massachusetts, and with it the value of her real estate,
will have perished from the natural and legitimate
effect of her meanness, extortion, and tyranny.</p>

<p>Looking to the future, then, there is no State in the
Union&mdash;certainly none outside of New England&mdash;that
has a greater interest in supplying her mechanics
with the greatest possible amount of capital; or in
supplying it at the lowest possible rates of interest.
And this can be done only by using her real estate as
banking capital.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>THE TRUE CHARACTER OF THE "NATIONAL" SYSTEM.</h3>


<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> 1.</h4>

<p>Under the "National" system there are less than
2,000 banks. But let us call them 2,000.</p>

<p>Calling the population of the country forty millions,
there is but one bank to 20,000 people.</p>

<p>And this one bank is, <i>in law</i>, a person; and only a
single person. In lending money, it acts, and can act,
only as a unit. Its several stockholders cannot act
separately, as so many individuals, in lending money.</p>

<p>So far, therefore, as this system is concerned, <i>there
is but one money lender for twenty thousand people</i>!</p>

<p>Of these 20,000 people, ten thousand (male and
female) are sixteen years of age and upwards, capable
of creating wealth, and requiring capital to make their
labor most productive.</p>

<p>Yet, so far as this system is concerned, there is but
one person authorized to lend money to, or for, these
ten thousand, who wish to borrow.</p>

<p>And this one money lender is one who, proverbially
"has no soul." It is not a natural human being. It
is a legal, an artificial, and not a natural, person. It is
neither masculine nor feminine. It has not the ordin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>ary
human sympathies, and is not influenced by the
ordinary human motives of action. It is no father,
who might wish to lend money to his children, to start
them in life. It is no neighbor, who might wish to
assist his neighbor. It is no citizen, who might wish
to promote the public welfare. It is simply a nondescript,
created by law, that wants money, and nothing
else.</p>

<p>Moreover, it has only $177,000 to lend to these
10,000 borrowers; <i>that is, a fraction less than $18, on
an average, for each one</i>!</p>

<p>What chance of borrowing capital have these ten
thousand persons, who are forbidden to borrow, except
from this one soulless person, who has so little to lend?</p>

<p>If money lenders must be soulless&mdash;as, perhaps, to
some extent, they must be&mdash;it is certainly of the
utmost importance that there be so many of them, and
that they may have so much money to lend, as that
they may be necessitated, by their own selfishness, to
compete with each other, and thus save the borrowers
from their extortions.</p>

<p>But the "National" system says, not only that the
money lender shall be a soulless person, and one having
only a little money to lend, but that he shall also have
the whole field&mdash;a field of 10,000 borrowers&mdash;entirely
to himself!</p>

<p>It says that this soulless person shall have this whole
field to himself, notwithstanding he has so little money
to lend, and notwithstanding there are many other persons
standing by, having, in the aggregate, fifty times<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
as much money to lend as he; and desiring to lend it
at one half, or one third, the rates he is demanding, and
extorting!</p>

<p>It says, too, that he shall have this whole field
to himself, notwithstanding that ninety-nine one-hundredths
of those who desire to borrow, are sent away
empty! and are thereby condemned&mdash;so far as such a
system can condemn them&mdash;to inevitable poverty!</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> 2.</h4>

<p>But further. Each one of these 2,000 legal, or artificial,
persons, who alone are permitted to <i>lend</i> money,
is made up of, say, fifty actual, or natural, persons, to
whom alone, it is well known, that this legal person
will lend it!</p>

<p>These 2,000 legal persons, then, who alone are permitted
to lend money, are made up of 100,000 actual
persons, who alone are to borrow it.</p>

<p>These 100,000 actual persons, who compose the
legal persons, do not, then, become bankers because
they have money to lend to others, but only because
they themselves want to borrow!</p>

<p>Thus when the system says that they alone shall
lend, it virtually says that they alone shall borrow;
because it is well known that, in practice, they <i>will</i>
lend only to themselves.</p>

<p>In short, it says that only these 100,000 men&mdash;or
one in four hundred of the population&mdash;shall have
liberty either to lend, or borrow, capital! Such capital<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
as is indispensable to every producer of wealth, if he
would control his own industry, or make his labor most
productive.</p>

<p>Consequently, it says, practically&mdash;so far as it is in
its power to say&mdash;that only one person in four hundred
of the population shall be permitted to have capital;
or, consequently, to labor directly for himself;
and that all the rest of the four hundred shall be compelled
to labor for this one, at such occupations, and
for such wages, as he shall see fit to dictate.</p>

<p>In short, the system says&mdash;as far as it can say&mdash;that
only 100,000 persons&mdash;only one person in four
hundred of the population&mdash;<i>shall be suffered to have
any money</i>! And, consequently, that all the property
and labor of the thirty-nine million nine hundred thousand
(39,900,000) persons shall be under the practical,
and nearly absolute, control of these 100,000 persons!
It says that thirty-nine million nine hundred thousand
(39,900,000) persons shall be in a state of industrial
and commercial servitude (to the 100,000), elevated
but one degree above that of chattel slavery.</p>

<p>And this scheme is substantially carried out in practice.
These 100,000 men call themselves "<i>the business
men</i>" of the country. By this it is meant, not
that they are the producers of wealth, but only that
they alone handle the money! Other persons are permitted
to sell only to them! to buy only of them! to
labor only for them! and to sell to, buy of, and labor
for, them, only at such prices as these 100,000 shall
dictate.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>These 100,000 so called "<i>business men</i>," not only
own the government, but they <i>are</i> the government.
Congress is made up of them, and their tools. And
they hold all the other departments of the government
in their hands. Their sole purpose is power and plunder;
and they suffer no constitutional or natural law
to stand in the way of their rapacity.</p>

<p>How many times, during the last presidential canvass,
were we told that "<i>the business men</i>" of the
country wished things to remain as they were? Having
gathered all power into their own hands, having
subjected all the property and all the labor of the
country to their service and control, who can wonder
that they were content with things as they were?
That they did not desire any change? And their
money and their frauds being omnipotent in carrying
elections, there was no change.</p>

<p>These 100,000 "business men," having secured to
themselves the control of all bank credits, and thereby
the control of all business depending on bank loans;
having also obtained control of the government, enact
that foreigners shall not be permitted to compete with
them, by selling goods in our markets, except under a
disadvantage of fifty to one hundred per cent.</p>

<p>And this is the industrial and financial system which
the "National" bank system establishes&mdash;so far as it
can establish it. And this is the scheme by means of
which these 100,000 men cripple, and more than half
paralyze, the industry of forty millions of people, and
secure to themselves so large a portion of the proceeds
of such industry as they see fit to permit.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>AMASA WALKER'S OPINION OF THE AUTHOR'S SYSTEM.</h3>


<p>As Mr. Amasa Walker is considered the highest
authority in the country, in opposition to all paper
currency that does not represent gold or silver actually
on hand, it will not be impertinent to give his opinion
of the system now proposed.</p>

<p>He reviewed it in a somewhat elaborate article,
entitled "<i>Modern Alchemy</i>," published in the <i>Bankers
Magazine (N. Y.)</i> for December, 1861.</p>

<p>That he had no disposition to do any thing but condemn
the system to the best of his ability, may be
inferred from the following facts.</p>

<p>After describing the efforts of the old alchemists to
transmute the baser metals into gold, he represents all
attempts to make a useful paper currency as attempts
"<i>to transmute paper into gold</i>." He says that the
idea that paper can be made to serve the purposes of
money is "<i>a perfectly cognate idea</i>" with that of the
old alchemists, that the baser metals can be transmuted
into gold. (p. 407.)</p>

<p>He also informs us that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is perfectly impracticable <i>to transmute paper
into gold</i> to any extent or degree whatever, and that
all attempts to do so (beneficially to the trade and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
commerce of the world) are as absurd and futile as the
efforts of the old alchemists to change the baser metals
into the most precious." (p. 415).</p></div>

<p>These extracts are given to show the spirit and
principle of his article, and the kind of arguments he
employs against all paper that represents other property
than coin; even though that property have equal
value with coin in the market.</p>

<p>Yet he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"One thing we cheerfully accord to <span class="smcap">Mr. Spooner's</span>
system&mdash;<i>it is an honest one</i>. Here is no fraud, no
deception. <i>It makes no promise that it cannot fulfil.</i>
It does not profess to be convertible into specie [on
demand]. It is the best transmutation project we
have seen." (p. 413).</p></div>

<p>When he says that "it is the best <i>transmutation</i>
project he has seen," the context shows that he means
to say that it <i>comes nearer to transmuting paper into
gold</i>, than any other system he has seen.</p>

<p>This admission, coming from so violent an opponent
of paper currency, may reasonably be set down as the
highest commendation that <i>he</i> could be expected to
pay to any <i>paper</i> system.</p>

<p>He also says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Many schemes of the same kind have, at different
times, been presented to the world; but none of them
have been more complete in detail, or more systematically
arranged, than that of <span class="smcap">Mr. Spooner</span>. (p. 414).</p></div>

<p>But by way of condemning the system as far as possible,
he says:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Spooner</span>, however, can, we think, make no
claim to originality, so far as the general principle is
concerned. The famous bank of <span class="smcap">John Law</span>, in France,
was essentially of the same character." (p. 413.)</p></div>

<p>No, it was <i>not</i> essentially of the same character.
One difference&mdash;to say nothing of twenty others&mdash;between
the two systems was this: that <span class="smcap">Law's</span> bank
issued notes that it had no means to redeem; whereas
<span class="smcap">Mr. Walker</span> himself admits that "<span class="smcap">Mr. Spooner's</span> <i>system
makes no promises that it cannot fulfil</i>." That is
to say, it purports to represent nothing except what
it actually represents, viz.: property that is actually
on hand, and can always be delivered, <i>on demand</i>, in
redemption of the paper. Is not this difference an
"essential" one? If <span class="smcap">Mr. Walker</span> thinks it is not, he
differs "essentially" from the rest of mankind. What
fault was ever found with <span class="smcap">John Law's</span> bank, except
that it could not redeem its paper? Will <span class="smcap">Mr. Walker</span>
inform us?</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
